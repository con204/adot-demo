# ADOT Demo

Simple microservice using OpenTelemetry libraries that are compatible with Jaeger and AWS X-Ray. It does make use of ADOT Collector to send traces to AWS X-Ray.

This demo is based on https://github.com/ChrisJBurns/jaeger-distributed-tracing-demo. I recommend to read his [blog post](https://capgemini.github.io/development/Distributed-Tracing-with-OpenTelemetry-And-Jaeger/) for a better understanding of how traces in this microservices are implemented
